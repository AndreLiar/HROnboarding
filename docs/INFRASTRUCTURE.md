# HR Onboarding - Infrastructure Guide

## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Overview

The HR Onboarding application uses a **zero-cost enterprise-grade infrastructure** approach, implementing advanced features like remote state management and blue/green deployments without additional Azure costs.

## üéØ Architecture Principles

### **Zero-Cost Strategy**
- **GitHub-based Terraform state** instead of Azure Storage
- **Container-based blue/green deployment** instead of paid App Service slots  
- **Free-tier monitoring** with Application Insights
- **Open-source security scanning** tools
- **GitHub Actions** for all automation

### **Enterprise Features Achieved**
- ‚úÖ **Remote State Management** with encryption and locking
- ‚úÖ **Blue/Green Deployment** with zero downtime
- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure Testing** with security and compliance scanning
- ‚úÖ **Cost Monitoring** with budget alerts
- ‚úÖ **Automated Rollback** with health validation

## üõ†Ô∏è Infrastructure Components

### **1. Terraform State Management**

#### **GitHub-Based Remote State**
```yaml
Storage Location: .github/terraform-state/encrypted-states/
Encryption: AES-256-CBC with PBKDF2
Locking: GitHub repository-based coordination
Versioning: Git history with automatic backups
```

#### **State Management Commands**
```bash
# Encrypt and store state
.github/scripts/encrypt-state.sh encrypt dev terraform.tfstate

# Restore state from repository
.github/scripts/encrypt-state.sh decrypt dev terraform.tfstate

# Create state lock
.github/scripts/encrypt-state.sh lock dev terraform

# List all environments
.github/scripts/encrypt-state.sh list
```

#### **State Security Features**
- **End-to-end encryption** with repository secrets
- **Integrity validation** with SHA-256 checksums
- **Access control** via GitHub repository permissions
- **Audit trail** through Git commit history
- **Automatic backups** before any state changes

### **2. Blue/Green Deployment Strategy**

#### **Zero-Cost Implementation**
```yaml
Blue Environment: New deployment with unique identifier
Green Environment: Current production (kept as rollback)
Switching Method: Environment variable configuration
Health Validation: Comprehensive API and frontend checks
Rollback Time: < 30 seconds via configuration switch
```

#### **Deployment Flow**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Deploy Blue] --> B[Health Check Blue]
    B --> C{All Checks Pass?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Switch Traffic to Blue]
    C -->|No| E[Emergency Rollback]
    D --> F[Green becomes Standby]
    E --> G[Blue Cleanup]
```

#### **Health Check Suite**
```bash
# Comprehensive health validation
./deployment/health-checks/comprehensive-health.sh \
  https://api-url.azurewebsites.net \
  https://frontend-url.azurewebsites.net

# Individual check components:
- API endpoint responsiveness
- Database connectivity validation  
- OpenAI API integration testing
- Frontend application loading
- End-to-end workflow simulation
- Performance metrics validation
```

### **3. Infrastructure Testing Pipeline**

#### **Automated Testing Types**
- **Terraform Validation** - Syntax, formatting, and plan validation
- **Security Scanning** - Checkov and tfsec for vulnerability detection
- **Cost Estimation** - Infracost integration for budget analysis
- **Compliance Checking** - Best practices and governance validation
- **Performance Analysis** - Optimization and efficiency assessment

#### **Security Scanning Tools**
```yaml
Checkov: Infrastructure security best practices
tfsec: Terraform-specific security analysis
Custom Rules: Environment-specific compliance checks
Reports: JSON and markdown output formats
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Operational Procedures

### **State Management Operations**

#### **Manual State Backup**
```bash
# Create manual backup before major changes
.github/scripts/encrypt-state.sh backup production

# Validate state integrity
.github/scripts/encrypt-state.sh validate production

# List all available states
.github/scripts/encrypt-state.sh list
```

#### **State Recovery**
```bash
# Restore from backup
git checkout HEAD~1 -- .github/terraform-state/encrypted-states/production.tfstate.enc

# Decrypt for emergency access
.github/scripts/encrypt-state.sh decrypt production emergency-restore.tfstate
```

### **Blue/Green Operations**

#### **Manual Blue/Green Deployment**
```bash
# Trigger via GitHub Actions
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "Blue/Green Deployment with Zero Cost Strategy"  
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select branch and environment
5. Monitor deployment progress
```

#### **Emergency Rollback**
```bash
# Via GitHub Actions
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "Rollback HR Onboarding Application"
3. Choose environment and target version
4. Provide rollback reason
5. Execute rollback

# Manual emergency rollback
az webapp config appsettings set \
  --resource-group hr-onboarding-prod-rg \
  --name hr-onboarding-prod-api \
  --settings ACTIVE_VERSION="green"
```

### **Infrastructure Validation**

#### **Pre-Deployment Testing**
```bash
# Run infrastructure tests
1. Create PR with infrastructure changes
2. Automatic testing triggers
3. Review test results and artifacts
4. Address any issues before merge
```

#### **Manual Infrastructure Testing**
```bash
# Trigger comprehensive testing
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "Infrastructure Testing and Validation"
3. Choose test type (validate/security/cost/all)
4. Review generated reports and artifacts
```

## üìà Performance Optimization

### **Infrastructure Performance**
```yaml
Deployment Speed: ~8-12 minutes end-to-end
Rollback Speed: <30 seconds via configuration switch
State Operations: <2 minutes for encrypt/decrypt
Health Checks: <5 minutes comprehensive validation
Cost Efficiency: 90%+ savings over traditional approaches
```

### **Optimization Strategies**
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple deployment jobs run concurrently
- **Artifact Caching**: Reuse build artifacts across environments
- **Smart Health Checks**: Progressive validation with early failure detection
- **Resource Pooling**: Shared resources across environments where possible

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **State Management Issues**
```bash
# State corruption
Problem: Encrypted state file corrupted
Solution: Restore from Git history or backup

# Missing encryption key
Problem: STATE_ENCRYPTION_KEY not available
Solution: Verify GitHub repository secrets configuration

# Lock conflicts
Problem: State lock prevents operations
Solution: Check .github/terraform-state/state-locks/ and resolve manually
```

#### **Blue/Green Deployment Issues**
```bash
# Health check failures
Problem: Blue environment fails health validation
Solution: Check Application Insights logs and fix issues

# Traffic switch failures  
Problem: Configuration switch doesn't take effect
Solution: Restart App Service or check environment variables

# Rollback issues
Problem: Green environment not responding
Solution: Check previous deployment artifacts and logs
```

#### **Infrastructure Testing Issues**
```bash
# Security scan failures
Problem: Security tools detect vulnerabilities
Solution: Review scan reports and update Terraform configuration

# Cost estimation failures
Problem: Infracost cannot generate estimates
Solution: Check Terraform configuration and API access

# Compliance failures
Problem: Best practices validation fails
Solution: Review compliance report and update infrastructure
```

## üîÑ Migration Guide

### **From Traditional Infrastructure**

#### **State Migration**
```bash
# 1. Backup existing state
